Fermentis Safale US-05 Dry Ale Yeast,72,-1,Low-Medium,59,75,Ready-to-pitch American ale yeast for well balanced beers with low diacetyl and a very crisp end palate.
White Labs Abbey Ale,75.5,-1,Medium-High,66,72,"Used to produce Trappist style beers. Similar to WLP500, but is less fruity and more alcohol tolerant (up to 15% ABV). Excellent yeast for high gravity beers, Belgian ales, dubbels and trippels."
White Labs American Hefeweizen Ale,72.5,-1,Low,65,69,"This yeast is used to produce the Oregon style American Hefeweizen. Unlike WLP300, this yeast produces a very slight amount of the banana and clove notes. It produces some sulfur, but is otherwise a clean fermenting yeast, which does not flocculate well, producing a cloudy beer."
White Labs American Lager,77.5,-1,Medium,50,55,This yeast is used to produce American style lagers. Dry and clean with a very slight apple fruitiness. Sulfur and diacetyl production is minimal.
White Labs Bastogne Belgian Ale,77,-1,Medium,66,72,"A high gravity, Trappist style ale yeast. Produces dry beer with slight acidic finish. More clean fermentation character than WLP500 or WLP530. Not as spicy as WLP530 or WLP550. Excellent yeast for high gravity beers, Belgian ales, dubbels and trippels."
White Labs Bedford British Ale,76,-1,High,65,70,"Ferments dry and flocculates very well. Produces a distinctive ester profile. Good choice for most English style ales including bitter, pale ale, porter, and brown ale."
White Labs Belgian Ale,75,-1,Medium,68,78,"Saisons, Belgian Ales, Belgian Reds, Belgian Browns, and White beers are just a few of the classic Belgian beer styles that can be created with this yeast strain. Phenolic and spicy flavors dominate the profile, with less fruitiness then WLP500."
White Labs Belgian Golden Ale,77.5,-1,Low,68,75,"From East Flanders, versatile yeast that can produce light Belgian ales to high gravity Belgian beers (12% ABV). A combination of fruitiness and phenolic characteristics dominate the flavor profile. Some sulfur is produced during fermentation, which will dissipate following the end of fermentation."
White Labs Belgian Saison I,70,-1,Medium,68,75,"Classic Saison yeast from Wallonia. It produces earthy, peppery, and spicy notes. Slightly sweet. With high gravity saisons, brewers may wish to dry the beer with an alternate yeast added after 75% fermentation."
White Labs Belgian Wit Ale,76,-1,Low-Medium,67,74,"Slightly phenolic and tart, this is the original yeast used to produce Wit in Belgium."
