BeerSmith Notes
    Has too many panels and gizmos
    Add a menu of "Tools" like beersmith for quick calcs?
    Fermentation "profiles" dictate timings
        let each project have its own "profile", but prepopulate from common profiles
    Calander text is almost illegible (too small) and no continuous timeline
        Make a normal "calander" style with next/prev month and year and "today"
        have active projects show continuous timelines with "event" icons on event days
        each project has a "color" (randomly selected? or from a palette?)
    Need an "add style" menu option
    Redo top menu to make more intuitive and expandable
        the notebook tabs are "Views"
