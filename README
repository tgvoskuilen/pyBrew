pyBrew
====================
pyBrew is an open source cross-platform homebrewing program built with wxPython.

It is in 'Alpha', so it could use some refinement and new features, but is
usable as is.

It is tested in Windows (Vista and 7) and Ubuntu, but should work in any platform
that wxPython works in.

Check out some screenshots in the screenshots folder to see how the interface looks.

Installation
--------------------------------------------

### Ubuntu

Make sure python 2.7 is installed and install wxPython with

    sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8

### Windows 7

First install python 2.7 for Windows (http://www.python.org/getit/), 
then install wxPython 2.8 with the appropriate
Windows binary from (http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)


### Mac OSX and Others

Follow the instructions for Windows 7, but choose the Mac installers instead.
I have not tested this.


Usage Guide
--------------------------------------------

Home:
  pyBrew manages your projects and recipes. The Home panel shows all your
  current ones. You can add new ones with the top menus. All your data is pickled
  in the UserData folder. If you want it in a more portable format, use the
  "Export Project" to get a text file.
   
Projects:
  This is the project explorer, which shows the details of each project.
  Use the tabs on the left to navigate categories and as you add your ingredients
  the calculated values will show up. This can be handy if you want to 'wing it'
  while making a batch :)
  
Recipes:
  Upload your favorite recipes here. A potential future feature would be to auto-load
  a recipe into a new project.
    
If you have any suggestions for features and can help add them, feel free to

Known Bugs:
  * Parts of it are ugly. I don't like the way the top tabs fit with the rest
    of the panels. Suggestions?
