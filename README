pyBrew is an open source cross-platform homebrewing program built with wxPython.

It is in 'Alpha', so it could use some refinement and new features, but is
usable as is.

It is tested in Windows (Vista and 7) and Ubuntu, but should work in any platform
that wxPython works in.

Check out some screenshots in the screenshots folder to see how the interface looks.

** Usage Guide **

Home:
  pyBrew manages your projects and recipes. The Home panel shows all your
  current ones. You can add new ones with the top menus. All your data is pickled
  in the UserData folder. If you want it in a more portable format, use the
  "Export Project" to get a text file.
  
Calendar:
  The calendar is not finished yet, but could show your projects, and when
  you are due to bottle or taste them.
  
Projects:
  This is the project explorer, which shows the details of each project.
  Use the tabs on the left to navigate categories and as you add your ingredients
  the calculated values will show up. This can be handy if you want to 'wing it'
  while making a batch :)
  
Recipes:
  Upload your favorite recipes here. A potential future feature would be to auto-load
  a recipe into a new project.
  
Styles:
  This panel is not implemented yet, but a few styles are hard coded. This would
  offer the potential to add new styles, which you can compare to your projects
  as you brew (target gravities, color, IBUs, etc...)

Known Bugs:
  * When it first loads if you double click on a project in the project list, the
    project doesn't load. Switch tabs away from 'Project' then come back and it
    will be loaded. I'm not sure why this happens.
    
  * Parts of it are ugly. I don't like the way the top tabs fit with the rest
    of the panels. Suggestions?
